# Homework #0
### Deadline (hard):  Your assigned laboratory in week 18-24 of October.

The first homework is easy, and consists of two parts:
1. Install arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2.  Create a public Github repository, according to these specifications:
  * You can use  this as  an example  (will be updated as  we  homework progresses):  https://github.com/Irikos/IntroductionToRobotics
  * Repository must be name ”IntroductionToRobotics” (or something very similar, but with a good reason)
  * Must include similar `Readme.md` with title, initial description and subsesction for each homework (with specified details)
  * You are free (and encouraged) to be creative with your repository description. However, the freedom of creativity must not be confused with and excuse to be lazy. The requirements specified here and in the repository description are considered basic and must be met.

These items must be met before the laboratory, and will be verified at the start of class. Feel free to PM with the Github repo link if you finish early.
